# Hi there 👋

I'am Muzammil Saify from India. I'm most interested in web development and want to become a full stack developer at some point. For now I'm learning static sites and thinking of doing
some javascript projects. You can also find me on:

## Some of my awesome projects

All the repos for the projects can be found on this profile itself with the project name(in bold)
